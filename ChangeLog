Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Apr 7 19:56:22 2019 -0700

    If you use data_file_url(), you must first call init_progfile_dir().
    
    And if you call init_progfile_dir(), you must call
    init_process_policies() before that.
    
    And even if you *don't* use data_file_url(), you might use it in the
    future, or you might use other calls to get data file paths, so make
    *all* the extcap programs make those calls.
    
    (Yes, this is important on macOS, for example; it may also be important
    on Windows.  On other UN*Xes we may just compile in the data file path,
    but that's not true on *all* our platforms.)

    TLS: fix potential buffer overflow with a malicious SSL 3.0 session
    
    If a TLS 1.2 cipher suite with SHA384 was in use for a SSL 3.0 session,
    then the "dgst" buffer in ssl3_check_mac could be overwritten with 24
    bytes past the end of the buffer. To prevent this issue, restrict the
    cipher suites that can be used with SSL 3.0.
    
    I did not verify this theory with an actual capture since it is hard to
    do so. An attacker would have to (1) create a malicious, non-compliant
    implementation that (2) creates a network trace, and (3) convince the
    user to install the required decryption secrets.

    Fix up the checks in nspm_signature_version().
    
    Move the read out of nspm_signature_version(), to make it a bit clearer
    what file I/O we do in the open process; have nspm_signature_version()
    just look for a signature in a single page.
    
    In the loop in nspm_signature_version(), make sure we have enough of the
    record header to look at the type and length fields in that header
    before looking at them and, when we can look at them, make sure the
    length of the record 1) fits in what remains of the page we're looking
    at and 2) is big enough to be the length of a signature record.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>

    Fix the test for a NetScaler trace file.
    
    When testing the signature field against a given version's signature:
    
            we require that the signature field's size (size, not C
            null-terminated string length) be at least the size of the
            signature string (otherwise, it can't possibly match);
    
            we check to make sure that the first N bytes of the signature
            field, where N is the size of the version's signature string
            (not including any terminating '\0' in that string), match the
            version's signature string.
    
    I.e., we require that the version's signature string is a prefix of the
    signature string in the file.
    
    This does not require that the signature string in the file be
    null-terminated.
    
    It also doesn't allow the file's signature string to be a substring of
    the version's signature string, as that's *NOT* sufficient to identify
    the file as a NetScaler trace file, especially if we forcibly
    null-terminate the file's signature string and we trucate it to be
    zero-length, as, in that case, it's *always* a prefix of the version's
    signature string, and the file is incorrectly identified as a NetScaler
    trace file.
    
    (While we're at it, we make the nspm_signature_isvXXX() routines return
    true if it *is* and false if it *isn't*, rather than the reverse; having
    a routine with a name containing "is", and not "isnt", return true if it
    *isn't* is confusing.)

    Discard the upper bits of the "network" field in the file header.
    
    Libpcap's done that for a while; we should do so as well.
    
    (Ideally, we should use those bits, but there's an issue with pcapng,
    where the FCS length in the IDB is described as being in units of bits,
    but where we're treating it as being in units of bytes, that I'd like to
    resolve first.)
